Used boot strap for these features
Navbar: The navigation bar adapts to different screen sizes, turning into a hamburger menu on smaller devices for better usability.
Buttons: We styled buttons consistently across the website with Bootstrap's button classes, ensuring they look good and are easily clickable.
Modal: The sign-in form pops up in a modal, a centered overlay that keeps the focus on the form until it's closed, enhancing user engagement.
Carousel: This feature displays a rotating set of images, like our latest sneaker collections, in a dynamic and interactive way.
Grid System: Bootstrap’s grid helps layout the website’s content neatly on all devices, ensuring everything aligns perfectly and is responsive.
Utility Classes: We used Bootstrap's utility classes for margins, paddings, and text alignment to reduce the need for custom CSS.
